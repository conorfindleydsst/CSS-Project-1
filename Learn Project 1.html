      <h2>The Pros and Cons of Conrad Johnson</h2>
      <p>First of all, Conrad has longer legs that the Rock. Also, he has a black stripe belt in karate, so he has very quick feet. All of these could possibly help Conrad beat the Rock. </p>
      <p>However, Conrad is also lacking in many areas. For one, Conrad is a toothpick compared to the log that is Dwayn Johnson. Also, Conrad doesn't weigh nearly as much as The Rock. Conrad is only 6 foot 4 compared to the Rock's 6 feet 5 inches. Conrad is also lacking in the experience area, as the Rock was a WWE superstar.</p>

      <h2>What Conrad Has to do to Have a Chance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use his long legs</li>
        <li>Avoid strong attacks</li>
        <li>Cry</li>
      </ul>
